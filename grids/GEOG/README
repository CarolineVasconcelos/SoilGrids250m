This repository contains a collection of updatable soil property and class maps of the world at a relatively coarse resolution (1 km, 250 m etc) produced using automated soil mapping based on Machine Learning. SoilGrids is a global soil data product generated at ISRIC ━ World Soil Information as a result of international collaboration (see list of contributing agencies) and as a proposed contribution to the Global Soil Partnership (http://www.fao.org/globalsoilpartnership/en/) initiative.

Important notice: the SoilGrids layers are of limited thematic (wide confidence limits) and spatial accuracy and still contain artefacts and missing pixels. Help us improve these maps by submitting a validation report or by contributing georeferenced soil profiles (points) and covariate data (rasters with global coverage at resolutions of 250 m or better). As soon as we receive a sufficient number of validation reports and/or new ground observations, we can re-run the predictions to produce an updated version of SoilGrids.
